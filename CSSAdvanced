Topics to be covered in CSS Advanced - 
1. Targeted Selectors.







 - Targeted Selectors - If we want to select a direct child of  a parent and style it, We can use Targeted Selectors
                        This allows us to style only the direct children. .foo > p{} This means the direct "p" child elements of foo parent.
- Psuedo Selectors 
                    1. nthChild - Select childs of the elements using li:first-child etc..
                    2. after   - This adds content after the element, but it does not add in the actual DOM object. It gets added via style.
                    3. before   - This gets added before the elementin use. Same as above.

-Box shadows -      Individual boxes can be stylised using box-shadow - offset-x, offset -y
